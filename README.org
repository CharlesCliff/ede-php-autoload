#+TITLE: ede-php-autoload

* Description

  This project simulates PHP autoloading system to use it in
  Semantic. It is composed of 3 parts:

  - An *EDE project*, =ede-php-autoload=, that defines autoloading
    configuration for a project. It is able to parse =composer.json=
    files to extract autoloading information from it
  - A *SemanticDB backend* that can find a tag by name using the
    autoload information of the current =ede-php-autoload= project
  - A *minor mode*, =ede-php-autoload-mode=, that enables the
    SemanticDB backend for a buffer.

* Defining autoloads for a project

  Let's assume we have a project located at =/home/me/my-project=. It
  has 3 namespaces:

  - =MyFirstNs=, located at =src/MyFirstNs=, and uses the PSR-0 norm
  - =MySecondNs=, located at =src/MySecondNs=, and uses the PSR-4 norm
  - =ThirdPartyNs=, located at =vendor/third-party/src=, and uses the PSR-4 norm

  Defining this project and its autoload information is done like this:

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (ede-php-autoload-project "My project"
                              :file "/home/me/my-project/main.php"
                              :class-autoloads '(:psr-0 (("MyFirstNs" . "src/MyFirstNs"))
                                                 :psr-4 (("MySecondNs" . "src/MySecondNs")
                                                         ("ThirdPartyNs" . "vendor/third-party/src"))))
  #+END_SRC

  If you have a =composer.json= configured with your autoloads at the
  root of your project, you can totally omit the =:class-autoloads=
  key. All autoloads in your =composer.json= and your dependencies
  ones will be parsed.

* Enabling the SemanticDB backend in php buffers

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (add-hook 'php-mode-hook #'ede-php-autoload-mode)
  #+END_SRC
